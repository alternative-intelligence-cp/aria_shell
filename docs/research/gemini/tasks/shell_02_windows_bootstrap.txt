Windows Bootstrap Protocol for Handle Mapping

PRIORITY: HIGH
STATUS: Windows-Specific Requirement
SOURCE: Custom Shell Design For Aria.txt, Section 3.2.2

PROBLEM:
Windows handles are opaque pointers, not fixed integers like POSIX FDs. Child processes don't know which handle is stddbg, stddati, etc. Need protocol to communicate handle assignments.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Environment Variable Injection:
   - Format: __ARIA_FD_MAP=3:0x1234;4:0x5678;5:0x9ABC
   - Injected before CreateProcess
   - Parsed by Aria runtime crt0 equivalent

2. Alternative: Command-Line Flag
   - Format: --aria-fd-map=3:0x1234;4:0x5678;5:0x9ABC
   - Less invasive than env var pollution

3. Aria Runtime Integration:
   - Parse bootstrap data before main()
   - Wrap Windows handles into Aria File objects
   - Expose via std.io module

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
- [ ] Design bootstrap protocol format
- [ ] Implement handle serialization (HANDLE to hex string)
- [ ] Add protocol to CreateProcess setup
- [ ] Create Aria runtime parser (in Aria codebase)
- [ ] Implement handle-to-File wrapper logic
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed maps
- [ ] Document protocol specification

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/platform/windows_bootstrap.cpp
- docs/BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md
- (Aria runtime): src/runtime/windows_init.cpp

RELATED:
- Requires coordination with Aria compiler team
- Must be in place before Windows shell can spawn Aria processes

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Windows shell can spawn Aria process with 6 streams
- Child process successfully wraps handles
- std.io.stddbg works in spawned process
- Protocol documented for third-party implementers
- Graceful failure if protocol data missing
