TBB Arithmetic Integration and Sticky Error Handling

PRIORITY: MEDIUM
STATUS: Aria-Specific Feature
SOURCE: Custom Shell Design For Aria.txt, Section 5.3

PROBLEM:
Standard shells silently overflow integers and ignore errors. Need Aria's Twisted Balanced Binary (TBB) arithmetic with sticky error propagation in shell scripts.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. TBB Type Support:
   - Shell variables can be declared as tbb8, tbb16, tbb32
   - Arithmetic operations use TBB semantics
   - Overflow produces ERR sentinel (-128 for tbb8)

2. Sticky Error Propagation:
   - If TBB operation produces ERR, value is "poisoned"
   - Any further operation with ERR propagates ERR
   - Using ERR in condition or exit code halts execution

3. Exit Code Mapping:
   - Exit code 0 → pass(0) result type
   - Exit code non-zero → fail(code) result type
   - ERR value as exit code → runtime error

4. Error Handling:
   - Shell script halts on sticky error (like set -e but for math)
   - Prevents silent corruption of logic
   - Error message shows origin of ERR value

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
- [ ] Link against Aria TBB library or reimplement
- [ ] Add TBB type declarations to shell type system
- [ ] Implement TBB arithmetic operators
- [ ] Add ERR sentinel detection
- [ ] Implement sticky error propagation
- [ ] Create error origin tracking (stack trace)
- [ ] Add configuration option to disable (for compatibility)
- [ ] Document TBB semantics in shell context

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/types/tbb_integration.cpp
- src/interpreter/error_propagation.cpp
- docs/TBB_IN_SHELL.md
- tests/tbb/overflow_tests.cpp

RESEARCH NOTES:
- TBB prevents silent overflow bugs common in shell scripts
- May be surprising to users coming from Bash
- Good documentation and error messages critical

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- tbb8:x = 127 + 1 produces ERR (-128)
- Using ERR in exit status halts script
- Error message shows where ERR originated
- Compatible with Aria language TBB semantics
- Can be disabled for legacy compatibility
