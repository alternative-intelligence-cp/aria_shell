Job Control and Background Processes

PRIORITY: MEDIUM
STATUS: Standard Shell Feature
SOURCE: Implied by process orchestration requirements

PROBLEM:
Users need to run processes in background, suspend/resume jobs, and manage multiple concurrent tasks. Standard shell feature.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Background Execution:
   - command & runs in background
   - Returns job ID immediately
   - Shell remains interactive

2. Job Management:
   - jobs: List active jobs
   - fg %n: Bring job n to foreground
   - bg %n: Resume suspended job in background
   - kill %n: Terminate job

3. Signal Handling:
   - Ctrl+Z: Suspend foreground job (SIGTSTP)
   - Ctrl+C: Terminate foreground job (SIGINT)
   - Job state tracking (running, stopped, done)

4. Process Groups:
   - Each job in separate process group
   - Terminal control (foreground process group)
   - Proper signal delivery to job

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
- [ ] Create JobManager class
- [ ] Implement process group management (setpgid)
- [ ] Add job state tracking
- [ ] Implement background execution (&)
- [ ] Add Ctrl+Z signal handling
- [ ] Implement fg/bg commands
- [ ] Create jobs listing
- [ ] Add terminal control (tcsetpgrp)
- [ ] Handle job completion notifications
- [ ] Implement Windows equivalent (suspend/resume)

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/jobs/job_manager.cpp
- src/jobs/process_group.cpp
- include/aria/shell/job.h
- src/signal/ctrl_z_handler.cpp

RESEARCH NOTES:
- Process groups critical for proper signal handling
- Windows doesn't have direct equivalent (must use threads/suspend)
- Job control requires terminal in raw mode cooperation

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- command & runs in background
- jobs shows active background jobs
- Ctrl+Z suspends foreground process
- fg brings job to foreground
- bg resumes suspended job
- Job completion notified asynchronously
- Works on POSIX systems (limited on Windows)
