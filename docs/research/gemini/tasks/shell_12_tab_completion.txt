Tab Completion Engine (Context-Aware)

PRIORITY: MEDIUM
STATUS: UX Enhancement
SOURCE: Implied by modern shell requirements

PROBLEM:
Users expect Tab completion for commands, files, variables, and arguments. Need context-aware completion system integrated with Aria module system.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Completion Sources:
   - Commands in PATH
   - Files/directories in current directory
   - Shell variables and environment variables
   - Aria modules and imports
   - Command-specific arguments (if metadata available)

2. Completion UI:
   - Tab: Cycle through completions
   - Display completion candidates
   - Highlight selected completion
   - Show descriptions for commands

3. Context Awareness:
   - After spawn("...", : Complete command names
   - After file operations: Complete file paths
   - After &{: Complete variable names
   - After use: Complete Aria module paths

4. Integration:
   - Query aria_make for available modules
   - Parse Aria project structure for completion
   - Support custom completion functions

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
- [ ] Create CompletionEngine class
- [ ] Implement command PATH scanning
- [ ] Add filesystem completion
- [ ] Implement variable name completion
- [ ] Add Aria module completion
- [ ] Create completion UI rendering
- [ ] Add cycling through candidates
- [ ] Implement description display
- [ ] Add custom completion hooks
- [ ] Optimize for performance (caching)

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/completion/completion_engine.cpp
- src/completion/path_completer.cpp
- src/completion/module_completer.cpp
- src/completion/ui_renderer.cpp
- include/aria/shell/completion.h

RESEARCH NOTES:
- Bash completion system overly complex
- Fish shell has excellent completion UX
- Caching critical for PATH scanning performance

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Tab completes commands from PATH
- Completes filenames with proper escaping
- Completes variable names after &{
- Shows completion candidates
- Fast enough to feel instant (<50ms)
- Works in multi-line input mode
